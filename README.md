### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, it did! At first, i didn't know how to fetch the data from the backend and I didn't feel like I could fetch my data from my database but the labs really helped me gain insights on how to do it. I also felt unprepared to complete the user authentication.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have tried to do the user authentication strecth feature and that would have helped me. Also, I would have not really worried about what i couldn't do but focus on what i could have made better.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I really liked how my project turned out. At the start of the week, it felt like I couldn't do it but i'm proud to say I was able to finish the MVP and the stretch features as well.
